=== User Registration

You can enable {{book.project.name}} to allow user self registration.  When enabled, the login page has a registration
link the user can click on to create their new account.  Enabling registration is pretty simple.  Go to the
`Realm Settings` left menu and click it.  Then go to the `Login` tab.  There is a `User Registration` switch on this
tab.  Turn it on, then click the `Save` button.

Clicking on this link will bring the user to the registration page where they have to enter in some user profile information
and a new password.

.Registration Form

You can change the look and feel of the registration form as well as removing or adding additional fields that must be entered.
