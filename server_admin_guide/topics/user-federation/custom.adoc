=== Custom Providers

{{book.project.name}} does have a private SPI for User Storage Federation that you can use to write your own custom providers.
There is no commercial support for this yet.  You can find some documentation for this in our link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/server-developer-guide/content/[community documentation].
This SPI is slated for a major rewrite before commercial support will be provided.
