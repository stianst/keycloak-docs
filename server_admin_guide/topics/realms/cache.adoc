=== Clearing Server Caches

{{book.project.name}} will cache everything it can in memory within the limits of your JVM and/or the limits you've configured
it for.  If the {{book.project.name}} database is modified by a third party (i.e. a DBA) outside the scope of the server's REST APIs or Admin Console
there's a chance parts of the in-memory cache may be stale.  You can clear the realm and user caches from the Admin Console by going
to the `Realm Settings` left menu item and the `Cache` tab.

Just click the `clear` button on the cache you want to evict.
