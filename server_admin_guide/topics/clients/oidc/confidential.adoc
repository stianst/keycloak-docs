==== Confidential Client Credentials

If you've set the client's <<fake/../../../clients/client-oidc.adoc#_access-type, access type>> to `confidential` in the client's
`Settings` tab, a new `Credentials` tab will show up. As part of dealing with this
type of client you have to configure the client's credentials.

The `Client Authenticator` list box specifies the type of credential you are going to use for your confidential client.
It defaults to client ID and secret.  The secret is automatically generated for you and the `Regenerate Secret`
button allows you to recreate this secret if you want or need to.

Alternatively, you can opt to use a signed Json Web Token (JWT) instead of a secret.

When choosing this credential type you will have to also generate a private key and certificate for the client.  The private key
will be used to sign the JWT, while the certificate is used by the server to verify the signature.  Click on the
`Generate new keys and certificate` button to start this process.

.Generate Keys

When you generate these keys, {{book.project.name}} will store the certificate, and you'll need to download the private key
and certificate for your client to use.  Pick the archive format you want and specify the password for the private key
and store.

You can also opt to
generate these via an external tool and just import the client's certificate.

.Import Certificate

There are multiple formats you can import from, just choose the archive format you have the certificate stored in,
select the file, and click the `Import` button.
