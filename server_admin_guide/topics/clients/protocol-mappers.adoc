=== OIDC Token and SAML Assertion Mappings

Applications that receive ID Tokens, Access Tokens, or SAML assertions may need or want different user metadata and roles.
{{book.project.name}} allows you to define what exactly is transferred.
You can hardcode roles, claims and custom attributes.
You can pull user metadata into a token or assertion.
You can rename roles.
Basically you have a lot of control of what exactly goes back to the client.

Within the Admin Console, if you go to an application you've registered, you'll see a `Mappers` tab.  Here's one for
an OIDC based client.

.Mappers Tab

Each client has several built-in mappers that are created for it by default.  They map things like, for example, email address to
a specific claim in the identity and access token.  Their function should each be self explanatory from their name.  There
are additional pre-configured mappers that are not attached to the client that you can add
by clicking the `Add Builtin` button.

Each mapper has common settings as well as additional ones depending on which type of mapper you are adding.  Click the `Edit` button
next to one of the mappers in the list to get to the config screen.

The best way to learn about a config option is to hover over its tooltip.  There are a few config options that
are common to all mappers:

Consent::
  If your client requires consent, this mapper will be displayed on the consent screen shown to the user.
Consent Text::
  If your client requires consent and the `Consent` switch is on, this is the text that will be displayed by the user.
  The value for this text is localizable by specifying a substitution variable with `$\{var-name}` strings.  The
  localized value is then configured within property files in your theme.  See the link:{{book.developerguide.link}}[{{book.developerguide.name}}]
  for more information on localization.

Most OIDC mappers also allow you to control where the claim gets put.  You can opt to include or exclude the claim from both the
_id_ and _access_ tokens by fiddling with the `Add to ID token` and `Add to access token` switches.

Finally, you can also add other mapper types.  If you go back to the `Mappers` tab, click the `Create` button.

.Add Mapper

Pick a `Mapper Type` from the list box.  If you hover over the tooltip, you'll see a description of what that mapper type does.
Different config parameters will appear for different mapper types.
