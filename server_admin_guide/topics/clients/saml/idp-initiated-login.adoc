==== IDP Initiated Login

IDP Initiated Login is a feature that allows you to set up an endpoint on the {{book.project.name}} server that will log you into a specific application/client.
In the `Settings` tab for your client, you need to specify the `IDP Initiated SSO URL Name`.
This is a simple string with no whitespace in it.
After this you can reference your client at the following URL: `root/auth/realms/{realm}/protocol/saml/clients/{url-name}`

If your client requires a special relay state, you can also configure this on the `Settings` tab in the `IDP Initiated SSO Relay State` field.
Alternatively, browsers can specify the relay state in a `RelayState` query parameter, i.e.
`root/auth/realms/{realm}/protocol/saml/clients/{url-name}?RelayState=thestate`.
