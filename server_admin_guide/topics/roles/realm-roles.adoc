=== Realm Roles

Realm level roles are a global namespace to define your roles.  You can see the list of built-in and created roles
by clicking on the `Roles` left menu item.

The value for the `description` field is localizable by specifying a substitution variable with `$\{var-name}` strings.
The localized value is then configured within property files in your theme.  See the link:{{book.developerguide.link}}[{{book.developerguide.name}}]
for more information on localization.  If a client requires user _consent_, this description string will be displayed on the
consent page for the user.
