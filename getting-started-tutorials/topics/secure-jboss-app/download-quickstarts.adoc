=== Download, Build, Deploy Application Code

The project and code for the application you are going to secure is available in link:{{book.quickstartRepo}}[Red Hat Developers GitHub].  You will need the following
installed on your machine and available in your PATH before you can continue:

* Java JDK 8
* Apache Maven 3.1.1 or higher
* Git

You can obtain the code by cloning the repository at {{book.quickstartRepo}}. Follow these steps to download the code, build it,
and deploy it. Make sure your {{book.appServer}} application server is started before you run these steps.

.Clone Project
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ git clone {{book.quickstartRepo}}
$ cd redhat-sso-quickstarts/app-profile-jee-vanilla
$ mvn clean wildfly:deploy
----

You should see some text scroll down in the application server console window.  After the application is successfully deployed go to:

http://localhost:8080/vanilla

.Application Login Page

If you open up the application's _web.xml_ file you would see that the application is secured via `BASIC` authentication.
If you click on the login button on the login page, the browser
will pop up a BASIC auth login dialog.

The application is not secured by any identity provider, so anything you enter in the dialog box will result in a `Forbidden` message being
sent back by the server.  The next section describes how you can take this deployed application and secure it.
