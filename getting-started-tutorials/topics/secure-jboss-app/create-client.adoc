=== Create and Register Client

The next step you have to do is to define and register the client in the {{book.project.name}} Admin Console.  Log into
the Admin Console with your admin account as you did in previous tutorials.  In the top left hand drop down menu select and manage
the `demo` realm.  Click `Clients` in the left side menu.  This will bring you to the `Clients` page.

On the right hand side you should see a button named `Create`.  Click this button and fill in the fields as shown below:

.Add Client

After clicking the `Save` button your client application entry will be created.  You now have to go back to the {{book.appServer}}
instance that the application is deployed on and configure it so that this app is secured by {{book.project.name}}.  You can obtain
a template for the configuration you need by going to the `Installation` tab in the client entry in the {{book.project.name}} Admin Console.

Select the `Keycloak OIDC JBoss Subsystem XML` option.  This will generate an XML template that you'll need to cut and paste.
