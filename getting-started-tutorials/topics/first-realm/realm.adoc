=== Create a New Realm

Login to the {{book.project.name}} Admin Console using the account you created in the
<<fake/../../first-boot.adoc#_install-boot, Install and Boot>> tutorial.

Admin Console Link::
  http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/

Place the mouse over the top left corner drop down menu that is titled with `Master`.  If you are logged in the master realm
this drop down menu lists all the realms created.  The last entry of this drop down menu is always `Add Realm`.  Click
this to add a realm.

This menu option will bring you to the `Add Realm` page.  You will be creating a brand new realm from scratch so
enter in `demo` for the realm name and click `Create`.

After creating the realm you are brought back to the main Admin Console page. The current realm will now be set to
`demo`.  You can switch between managing the `master` realm and the realm you just created by doing a mouseover on the
top left corner drop down menu.
