=== Create a New User

In this section you are going to create a new user in the `demo` realm as well as a temporary password for that account.
The first step is to click on the `Users` in the left menu bar.

.Users

This menu option brings you to the user list page.  On the right side of the empty user list, you should see an `Add User`
button.  Click that to start creating your new user.

.Add User

The only required field is `Username`.  Click save.  This will bring you to the management page for your new user.

The next step is to define a temporary password for your new user.  Click on the `Credentials` tab to bring you to
the page that will allow you to do this.

.Set Temporary Password

Enter a new password and retype it within the `Password Confirmation` field.  Once you do this a red `Reset Password`
button should reappear.  Clicking on that will reset the user's password to the new one you specified.  Please note that
this is a temporary password and the user will be required to change it after they first log in.  You can make it permanent
by flipping the `Temporary` switch from `On` to `Off` before you click the `Reset Password` button.
