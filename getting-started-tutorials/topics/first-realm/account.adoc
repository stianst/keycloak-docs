After creating the user, logout of the management console by clicking the right hand drop down menu and selecting `Sign Off`.
Next, login to the User Account Service of your `demo` realm with the user you just created by clicking this link:

User Account Link::
  http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/demo/account

Enter the username and temporary password you created.  You will be asked to change and create a permanent password after you
successfully login.

Finally, you will be brought to the User Account Service.  Every user in a realm has access to this Account Service by default.
It allows you to update profile information and change or add additional credentials.  More information on this service is provided
in the link:{{book.adminguide.link}}[{{book.adminguide.name}}].
