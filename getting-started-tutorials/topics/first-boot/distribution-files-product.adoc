=== Installing Distribution Files

The {{book.project.name}} Server is contained in one distribution file:

* 'RH-SSO-{{book.project.version}}.[zip|tar.gz]'

The 'RH-SSO-{{book.project.version}}.[zip|tar.gz]' file is the server only distribution.  It contains nothing other than the scripts and binaries
to run the {{book.project.name}} server.

To unpack these files run the `unzip` or `gunzip` and `tar` utilities.
