* IDP entity descriptor XML file.  This describes the connection to {{book.project.name}} or another SAML IDP
* SP entity descriptor XML file.  This describes the SAML connections and config for the application you are securing.
* Private key PEM file.  This is a text file that defines the private key the application will use to sign documents.  It is
  in the PEM format
* Certificate PEM file.  This is a text file that defines the certificate for your application.
* _mod_auth_mellon_ specific Apache HTTPD module config.
