</SP>
----
entityID::
  This is the identifier for this client.
  The IDP needs this value to determine who the client is that is communicating with it. This setting is _REQUIRED_.

sslPolicy::
  This is the SSL policy the adapter will enforce.
  Valid values are: `ALL`, `EXTERNAL`, and `NONE`.
  For `ALL`, all requests must come in via HTTPS.
  For `EXTERNAL`, only non-private IP addresses must come over the wire via HTTPS.
  For `NONE`, no requests are required to come over via HTTPS.
  This settings is _OPTIONAL_. Default value is `EXTERNAL`.

nameIDPolicyFormat::
  SAML clients can request a specific NameID Subject format.
  Fill in this value if you want a specific format.
  It must be a standard SAML format identifier, i.e. `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient`.
  This setting is _OPTIONAL_.
  By default, no special format is requested. 

forceAuthentication::
  SAML clients can request that a user is re-authenticated even if they are already logged in at the IDP.
  Set this to `true` to enable. This setting is _OPTIONAL_.
  Default value is `false`.

isPassive::
  SAML clients can request that a user is never asked to authenticate even if they are not logged in at the IDP.
  Set this to `true` if you want this.
  Do not use together with `forceAuthentication` as they are opposite. This setting is _OPTIONAL_.
  Default value is `false`.

turnOffChangeSessionIdOnLogin::
  The session id is changed by default on a successful login on some platforms to plug a security attack vector.
  Change this to `true` to disable this.  It is recommended you do not turn it off.
  Default value is `false`.
