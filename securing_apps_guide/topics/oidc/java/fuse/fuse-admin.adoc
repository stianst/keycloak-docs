===== Secure Fuse Admin Services

====== SSH authentication to Fuse terminal

{{book.project.name}} mainly addresses usecases for authentication of web applications, however if your other web services and applications are protected
with {{book.project.name}}, it may be good to protect non-web admin services like SSH with {{book.project.name}} credentials too. It's possible to do it
by using JAAS login module, which allows to remotely connect to {{book.project.name}} and verify credentials based on
<<fake/../../../oidc-generic.adoc#_resource_owner_password_credentials_flow,Resource Owner Password Credentials>>.

Example steps for enable SSH authentication:

* In  {{book.project.name}} you need to create client (assume it's called `ssh-jmx-admin-client`), which will be used for SSH authentication.
This client needs to have switch `Direct grant enabled` to true.

* You need to update/specify this property in file `$FUSE_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg`:

[source]
----
sshRealm=keycloak
----

* Add file `$FUSE_HOME/etc/keycloak-direct-access.json` with the content similar to this (change based on your environment and {{book.project.name}} client settings):
[source,json]
----
{
    "realm": "demo",
    "resource": "ssh-jmx-admin-client",
    "realm-public-key": "MIGfMA...",
    "ssl-required" : "external",
    "auth-server-url" : "http://localhost:8080/auth",
    "credentials": {
        "secret": "password"
    }
}
----
This file contains configuration of the client application, which is used by JAAS DirectAccessGrantsLoginModule from `keycloak` JAAS realm for SSH authentication.

* Start Fuse and install `keycloak` JAAS realm into Fuse. This could be done easily by installing `keycloak-jaas` feature, which has JAAS realm predefined
(you are able to override it by using your own `keycloak` JAAS realm with higher ranking). Use those commands in Fuse terminal:

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
features:addurl mvn:org.keycloak/keycloak-osgi-features/{{book.project.version}}/xml/features
features:install keycloak-jaas
----

* Now let's type this from your terminal to login via SSH as `admin` user:

```
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no -p 8101 admin@localhost
```

And login with password `password`. Note that your user needs to have realm role `admin` . The required roles are configured in `$FUSE_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.shell.cfg`


====== JMX authentication

This may be needed in case if you really want to use jconsole or other external tool to perform remote connection to JMX through RMI. Otherwise it may
be better to use just hawt.io/jolokia as jolokia agent is installed in hawt.io by default.

* In file `$FUSE_HOME/etc/org.apache.karaf.management.cfg` you can change this property:

[source]
----
jmxRealm=keycloak
----

* You need `keycloak-jaas` feature and file `$FUSE_HOME/etc/keycloak-direct-access.json` as described in SSH section above.

* In jconsole you can fill URL like:

[source]
----
service:jmx:rmi://localhost:44444/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/karaf-root
----

and credentials: admin/password (based on the user with admin privileges according to your environment)

Note again that users without `admin` role are not able to login as they are not authorized. However users with access to Hawt.io admin console
may be still able to access MBeans remotely via HTTP (Hawtio). So make sure to protect Hawt.io web console with same roles like JMX through RMI to
really protect JMX mbeans.


====== Secure Fuse admin console

Fuse admin console is Hawt.io. See http://hawt.io/configuration/index.html[Hawt.io documentation] for more info about how to secure it with {{book.project.name}}.
