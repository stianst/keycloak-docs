===== Install Feature

First thing to be done is to install the feature `keycloak` into the JBoss Fuse environment. This will install the Fuse adapter
together with all needed 3rd party dependencies. There are 2 possibilities to install it.


====== Install from Maven Repository

You need to be online and have access to the maven repository.

{% if book.community %}
For community it's sufficient to be online as all the artifacts and 3rd party dependencies should be available in maven central repository.
{% endif %}
{% if book.product %}
For {{book.project.name}} you first need to configure proper maven repository, so you can install the artifacts. You can find on
https://access.redhat.com/maven-repository[Maven Repository] page what's the proper maven repository containing the bits.

Assuming it's https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/ you will need to add this to the file `$FUSE_HOME/etc/org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.cfg`
and add the repository to the list of supported repositories. For example it may look like this:

[source]
----
org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories= \
    https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga@id=redhat.product.repo
    http://repo1.maven.org/maven2@id=maven.central.repo, \
    ...
----
{% endif %}

You need to start JBoss Fuse and then in the Karaf terminal you type this:

[source]
----
features:addurl mvn:org.keycloak/keycloak-osgi-features/{{book.project.versionMvn}}/xml/features
features:install keycloak
----

Then in JBoss Fuse 6.2 you may need to install Jetty 8 feature:

[source]
----
features:install keycloak-jetty8-adapter
----

Or in JBoss Fuse 6.3 you may need to install Jetty 9 feature:

[source]
----
features:install keycloak-jetty9-adapter
----

Then you can check that requested features were installed:

[source]
----
features:list | grep keycloak
----

====== Install from ZIP bundle

This is useful if you are offline and/or don't want to use maven for download jar files and other artifacts. Once you download ZIP bundle of {{book.project.name}} Fuse adapter,
you will need to unzip it into the root directory of JBoss Fuse. This should install the dependencies under the `system` directory. For example see this for Fuse 6.2.1 :

[source]
----
cd /path-to-fuse/jboss-fuse-6.2.1.redhat-084
unzip -q /path-to-adapter-zip/keycloak-fuse-adapter-dist-{{book.project.versionMvn}}.zip
----

Feel free to overwrite all already existing jars. Once you unzip archive, you can start the Fuse and again run commands in fuse/karaf terminal

[source]
----
features:addurl mvn:org.keycloak/keycloak-osgi-features/{{book.project.versionMvn}}/xml/features
features:install keycloak
----

And also install the corresponding Jetty adapter. The difference from the previous part is, that nothing will be downloaded from maven repository as the artifacts were
available directly in JBoss Fuse `system` directory.
